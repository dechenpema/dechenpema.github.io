    <h2>Nintendo</h2>

    <p>
      I've been playing with Nintendo devices for as long as I could remember. My first ever gaming device was my DS!
      I then got a Wii, DSi, a 3DSXL, and most recently, a Nintendo Switch.

    <h3>My Favorite Games</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Animal Crossing: New Leaf - 3DS
        <p>
          I got Animal Crossing New Leaf during Christmas time of 2012. I originally got it for my 5-year-old sister at the time
          (because I thought the game was for small children), but I tried out the game and immediately got into it! I loved how immersive
          the gameplay was and how enjoyable interacting with the rest of the villagers was. The game is really just a pure bundle of joy! I'm
          VERY excited for the new Animal Crossing game coming out on the Nintendo Switch in 2020!
        </p>
      <li> Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch
        <p>
          The release of Breath of the Wild was the reason why I bought the Switch. It's open world gameplay is a big change for the
          Legend of Zelda franchise, and it got amazing reviews! Breath of the Wild won 189 Game of the Year awards (from various review sites)
          because of its unique game mechanics, vast landscape, and immersive atmosphere. The amount of detail and world building put into the
          game allows the player to almost always find something new to do/find, no matter how many hours they've racked up. I've easily put over 150
          hours into the game, and I haven't even finished looking at every location on the map! BotW has gained such phenomenal reviews that Nintendo
          announced they are working on a BoTW 2, something that the Legend of Zelda franchise hasn't done since Ocarina of Time (a LoZ classic)! LoZ
          usually just make enitrely new LoZ games, not sequels. As you probably already guessed, I'm VERY excited :)
    </ul>
